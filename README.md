The retinues added are the Roman Legion, and the Roman Mounted Legion. Heavy infantry with archers, and Heavy Cavalry with Horse archers respectively.
The retinues have a 50% morale boost, as well as 30% offense and defense. This is all balanced with +50% maintenance costs.

The Cultural Building does not follow the normal cultural buildings. This one gives retinue cap, and decreases levy. At max level, each one will give you enough retinue cap to have 2 Legions, before bonuses, and -50% levy.
